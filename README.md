# Trivial.Functional
FP concepts and techniques as well as other handy utilities.

## Disclaimer
This is an internal library used at Trivial Software to implement functional programming concepts and techniques in a manner that fits with C# ways of doing things.

The goal is not to strictly adhere to functional programming laws and requirements but to simply improve on certain shortcomings of OOP C# by borrowing from the functional paradigm. 

A pragmatic approach to FP in C# one might say.
